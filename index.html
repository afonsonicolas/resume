                <p class="summary">Born in Miami and raised in Miami, Colombia, Brazil, and Switzerland, Nicolas comes from a multicultural background with family roots from Spain and Costa Rica.  He speaks fluent English, Spanish, Portuguese, and is midway towards German proficiency. Beyond his curiosity for diversity of culture and thought, Nicolas' overseas upbringing sparked an interest in International Relations and Communication; to understand how messages and communication impact people of different experiences. </p>
                <p class="summary">Nicolas is currently a Master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology, studying for a Master of Science in Data Analytics. Using his growing knowledge in analytics, and having completed Bachelor's degrees in Public Relations (BS) and International Relations (BA) with a minor in Business Administration at Boston University (May '23), Nicolas wants to apply his expertise to further the purpose of a strategy, communications, and marketing team.</p>
                <p class="summary end">"As an undergraduate, I learned about different marketing and communications tactics, and I've had the chance to witness some in my internships and work experience. Now, applying the skills I'm gaining at Georgia Tech, I'm really excited to join a team that informs decision-making and evaluates marketing and communications strategies. It's exciting to find the solution to a seemingly unanswerable question - especially when that solution yields positive engagement with an audience." </p>
                <p class="summary">Most recently, Nicolas engaged with CEOs and COOs of small to mid-size businesses as an Account Manager at Kaseya, an IT software provider. "Working in sales has provided some fundamental skills I believe will help in any collaborative environment. Among the most important, listening, asking questions, and really understanding a person's point of view before drawing up conclusions will help me become a better leader and team-mate."</p>
                <p class="summary">Previously, Nicolas served as a crisis communications consultant at Grasso Group Communications in Boston, MA. Concurrently, he worked as a pro-bono PR manager for Service Dog Project, a charity organization that breeds, trains, and donates service animals to communities in need. Nicolas has also worked in B2B PR and business development for engineering firm, Aspen Systems (Boston, MA), where he expanded the organization's shared and owned media channels through value-driven content as well as providing strategic recommendations to diversify revenue streams. </p>
                <p class="summary">Certified in SEO, analytics, and inbound marketing, Nicolas has previously worked in luxury PR for Müller JG Jewelry in San Jose, Costa Rica as website and marketing strategy developer. Prior, he worked in health PR as an in-house communications intern for Sandoz (São Paulo, Brazil), a global leader in generic and bio-similar Pharma. </p>
                <p class="summary">At Boston University, Nicolas achieved the Dean's List award for six semesters. He has sat on the board of International Business Club, and has served as a chair for Model United Nations (MUN). During his time at MUN, Nicolas received six public-speaking awards in a span of ten conferences attended. </p>
                <p class="summary">After work, Nicolas enjoys reading the news and catching up on current politics, finance, and relevant industry trends. Due to his lack of a green thumb, Nicolas satisfies his love for plants and Legos by building Lego® Botanical sets and displaying them around the house. In his free time, Nicolas is an avid skier during the winter season, and enjoys golfing and kayaking in warmer months. </p>

                                    How much is an airline mile worth, and how do we identify a good deal when buying flights with airline miles?
                                    <br><br>
                                    According to nerdwallet, each AA mile is worth 1.7 cents on average. But did you know the average price of a mile from London to Miami is 5 cents? Or that Rio to Miami averages 2.4 cents per mile on a Thursday but 3.2 cents on Tuesdays and Sundays?
                                    <br><br>
                                    This program analyzes hundreds of thousands of flights to find the average price of a mile for any American Airlines route, on any cabin, with any number of stops desired by the user.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Using advanced multi-variate regression, factors affecting the dollar price of an airline mile can be found to calculate specific price averages for flights similar to a desired flight. By comparing this average to a desired flight, users can determine whether to buy their flight in dollars or airline miles.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Once complete, the program will have a front-end interface with visualizations and recommendations for users to decide whether to used dollars or miles to purchase an American Airlines flight.

                                    They operate mostly with donations from individuals who first encounter SDP on explore.com, a website with access to cameras across the world. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    SDP's cameras pointed at live feeds of their puppies and dog training.
                                    With a limited budget, but a loyal explore.com audience, SDP had lost control of their narrative to user-generated resources that acted as the main source of information.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a PR Account Manager, I led a team of 10 account executives to improve donor relations and recontrol digital channels to increase donation conversion.

            <p class="summary">Born in Miami and raised in Miami, Colombia, Brazil, and Switzerland, Nicolas comes from a multicultural background with family roots from Spain and Costa Rica.  He speaks fluent English, Spanish, Portuguese, and is midway towards German proficiency. Beyond his curiosity for diversity of culture and thought, Nicolas' overseas upbringing sparked an interest in International Relations and Communication; to understand how messages and communication impact people of different experiences. </p>
            <p class="summary">Nicolas is currently a Master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology, studying for an MS in Data Analytics. Using his growing knowledge in analytics, and having recently completed Bachelor's degrees in Public Relations (BS) and International Relations (BA) with a minor in Business Administration at Boston University (May '23), Nicolas wants to apply his expertise to further the purpose of a strategy, communications, and marketing team.</p>
            <p class="summary end">"As an undergraduate, I learned about different marketing and communications tactics, and I've had the chance to witness some of those in my internships and work experience. Now, applying the skills I'm gaining at Georgia Tech, I'm really excited to join a team that informs decision-making and evaluates marketing and communications strategies. It's exciting to find the solution to a seemingly unanswerable question - especially when that solution yields positive engagement with an audience." </p>
            <p class="summary">Most recently, Nicolas engaged with CEOs and COOs of small to mid-size businesses as an Account Manager at Kaseya, an IT software provider. "Working in sales has provided some fundamental skills I believe will help in any collaborative environment. Among the most important, listening, asking questions, and really understanding a person's point of view will help me become a better leader and team-mate."</p>
            <p class="summary">Previously, Nicolas served as a crisis management consultant at Grasso Group Communications in Boston, MA. Concurrently, he worked as a pro-bono PR manager for Service Dog Project, a charity organization that breeds, trains, and donates service animals to communities in need. Nicolas has also worked in B2B PR and business development for engineering firm, Aspen Systems (Boston, MA), where he expanded the organization's shared and owned media channels through value-driven content as well as providing strategic recommendations to diversify revenue streams. </p>
            <p class="summary">Certified in SEO, analytics, and inbound marketing, Nicolas has previously worked in luxury PR for Müller JG Jewelry in San Jose, Costa Rica as website and marketing strategy developer. Prior, he worked in health PR as an in-house communications intern for Sandoz (São Paulo, Brazil), a global leader in generic and bio-similar Pharma. </p>
            <p class="summary">At Boston University, Nicolas achieved the Dean's List award for six semesters. He has sat on the board of International Business Club, and has served as a chair for Model United Nations (MUN). During his time at MUN, Nicolas received six public-speaking awards in a span of ten conferences attended. </p>
            <p class="summary">After work, Nicolas enjoys reading the news and catching up on current politics, finance, and relevant industry trends. Due to his lack of a green thumb, Nicolas satisfies his love for plants and Legos by building Lego® Botanical sets and displaying them around the house. In his free time, Nicolas is an avid skier during the winter season, and enjoys golfing and kayaking in warmer months. </p>
